					<p>Earvin "Magic" Johnson Jr. (born August 14, 1959) is an American retired professional basketball player
					and former president of basketball operations of the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA).
					He played point guard for the Lakers for 13 seasons. After winning championships in high school and college, Johnson 
					was selected first overall in the 1979 NBA draft by the Lakers. He won a championship and an NBA Finals Most Valuable
					Player Award in his rookie season, and won four more championships with the Lakers during the 1980s. Johnson retired 
					abruptly in 1991 after announcing that he had contracted HIV, but returned to play in the 1992 All-Star Game, winning 
					the All-Star MVP Award. After protests from his fellow players, he retired again for four years, but returned in 1996, 
					at age 36, to play 32 games for the Lakers before retiring for the third and final time.
					Johnson's career achievements include three NBA MVP Awards, nine NBA Finals appearances, twelve All-Star games, and ten
					All-NBA First and Second Team nominations. He led the league in regular-season assists four times, and is the NBA's all-time 
					leader in average assists per game, at 11.2. Johnson was a member of the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team
					("The Dream Team"), which won the Olympic gold medal in 1992. After leaving the NBA in 1992, Johnson formed the Magic Johnson 
					All-Stars, a barnstorming team that traveled around the world playing exhibition games. Johnson was honored as one of the 50
					Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996.
