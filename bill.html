					<p>William Felton Russell (born February 12, 1934) is an American former professional basketball 
					player who played center for the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 
					1956 to 1969. A five-time NBA Most Valuable Player and a 12-time All-Star, he was the centerpiece of 
					the Celtics dynasty that won eleven NBA championships during his 13-year career. Russell and Henri Richard 
					of the National Hockey League are tied for the record of the most championships won by an athlete in a North 
					American sports league. Russell led the San Francisco Dons to two consecutive NCAA championships in 1955 and 
					1956, and he captained the gold-medal winning U.S. national basketball team at the 1956 Summer Olympics.
					Even though Russell never averaged more than 19.0 points per game or shot as much as 47 percent in any season 
					in an offense-friendly era, many regard him to be among the greatest basketball players of all time. He is 6 ft 
					10 in (2.08 m) tall, with a 7 ft 4 in (2.24 m) wingspan. His shot-blocking and man-to-man defense were major 
					reasons for the Celtics' domination of the NBA during his career. Russell was equally notable for his rebounding abilities.
					He led the NBA in rebounds four times, had a dozen consecutive seasons of 1,000 or more rebounds,[4] and remains second all-time
					in both total rebounds and rebounds per game. He is one of just two NBA players (the other being prominent rival Wilt Chamberlain)
					to have grabbed more than 50 rebounds in a game.
