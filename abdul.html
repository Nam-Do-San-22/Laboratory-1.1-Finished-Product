					<p>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (born Ferdinand Lewis Alcindor Jr.; April 16, 1947) is an American former professional 
					basketball player who played 20 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Milwaukee Bucks and 
					the Los Angeles Lakers. During his career as a center, Abdul-Jabbar was a record six-time NBA Most Valuable Player (
					MVP), a record 19-time NBA All-Star, a 15-time All-NBA selection, and an 11-time NBA All-Defensive Team member. A member 
					of six NBA championship teams as a player and two more as an assistant coach, Abdul-Jabbar twice was voted NBA Finals MVP. 
					In 1996, he was honored as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History. NBA coach Pat Riley and players Isiah Thomas and 
					Julius Erving have called him the greatest basketball player of all time.<br>
					After winning 71 consecutive basketball games on his high school team in New York City, Alcindor was recruited by Jerry Norman, 
					the assistant coach of UCLA,[6] where he played for coach John Wooden[7] on three consecutive national championship teams and was 
					a record three-time MVP of the NCAA Tournament. Drafted with the first overall pick by the one-season-old Bucks franchise in the 1969
					NBA draft, Alcindor spent six seasons in Milwaukee. After leading the Bucks to its first NBA championship at age 24 in 1971, he took 
					the Muslim name Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Using his trademark "skyhook" shot, he established himself as one of the league's top scorers. In 1975,
					he was traded to the Lakers, with whom he played the final 14 seasons of his career and won five additional NBA championships. Abdul-Jabbar's
					contributions were a key component in the "Showtime" era of Lakers basketball. Over his 20-year NBA career, his teams succeeded in making the 
					playoffs 18 times and got past the first round 14 times; his teams reached the NBA Finals on 10 occasions.</p>
