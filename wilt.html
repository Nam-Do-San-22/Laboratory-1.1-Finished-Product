					<p> Norman Chamberlain (/Ààt Ée…™mb…ôrl…™n/; August 21, 1936 ‚Äì October 12, 1999) was an American basketball player who played as a center and is 
					considered one of the greatest players in history. He played for the Philadelphia/San Francisco Warriors, the Philadelphia 76ers, and the 
					Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played for the University of Kansas and also for the Harlem Globetrotters 
					before playing in the NBA. Chamberlain stood 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m) tall, and weighed 250 pounds (110 kg) as a rookie[3] before bulking up to 275
					and eventually to over 300 pounds (140 kg) with the Lakers.

					Chamberlain holds numerous NBA records in scoring, rebounding, and durability categories. He is the only player to score 100 points in a single 
					NBA game or average more than 40 and 50 points in a season. He won seven scoring, eleven rebounding, and nine field goal percentage titles and 
					led the league in assists once.[2] Chamberlain is the only player in NBA history to average at least 30 points and 20 rebounds per game in a season, 
					which he accomplished seven times. He is also the only player to average at least 30 points and 20 rebounds per game over the entire course of his NBA career.
					Although he suffered a long string of losses in the playoffs,[4] Chamberlain had a successful career, winning two NBA championships, earning four regular-season 
					Most Valuable Player awards, the Rookie of the Year award, one NBA Finals MVP award, and was selected to 13 All-Star Games and ten All-NBA First and Second teams.
					He was subsequently enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1978, elected into the NBA's 35th Anniversary Team of 1980, and in 1996 he was
					chosen as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History.
