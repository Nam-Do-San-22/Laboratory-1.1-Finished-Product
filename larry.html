					<p>Larry Joe Bird (born December 7, 1956) is an American former professional basketball player, 
					coach and executive in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed "The Hick from French Lick" and ‚ÄúLarry Legend‚Äù,
					Bird is widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time.

					Drafted into the NBA by the Boston Celtics with the sixth overall pick in the 1978 NBA draft, Bird started at small forward and power forward 
					for the Celtics for 13 seasons. Bird was a 12-time NBA All-Star and received the NBA Most Valuable Player Award three consecutive times (1984‚Äì1986),
					making him the only forward in league history to do so. He played his entire professional career for Boston, winning three NBA championships and two 
					NBA Finals MVP awards. Bird was also a member of the gold-medal-winning 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team known as "The Dream Team". 
					He was voted to the NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team in 1996, was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1998, and was 
					inducted into the Hall of Fame again in 2010 as a member of "The Dream Team". He was rated the greatest NBA small forward of all time by Fox Sports in 2016.
					Bird was also ranked as the greatest Boston Celtics player of all time by MSN Sports in 2018.

					After retiring as a player, Bird served as head coach of the Indiana Pacers from 1997 to 2000. He was named NBA Coach of the Year for the 1997‚Äì1998 season 
					and later led the Pacers to a berth in the 2000 NBA Finals. In 2003, Bird was named president of basketball operations for the Pacers, holding the position 
					until retiring in 2012.[4] He was named NBA Executive of the Year for the 2012 season. Bird returned to the Pacers as president of basketball operations in 2013
					and remained in that role until 2017.
